Title: The Impact of Minerals on Global Economies: A Symbiosis of Earth and Commerce

The vibrant pulse of the global economy often resonates beyond the bustling stock markets or nuanced fiscal policies. Deep within the core of the Earth lies an influential extractive sector that plays an instrumental role in sculpting global economies - minerals and mining. This sector's impact permeates every element of our lives, from technology to the built environment, anchoring economic stability, technological development, and the very survival of industries across the planet. 

Howard Harper, a renowned Geologist, once affirmed, "Minerals are more than shiny, glittery objects; they are the bones of our modern society and economy". A glance at historical context underscores this assertion, demonstrating the profound relationship between minerals and economic prosperity.

The History: From Copper Age to Silicon Valleys

The transition from Stone Age to Bronze Age underscored the first significant reliance of economies on a mineral - copper. Civilizations discovered methods to extract and refine copper, subsequently alloying it with tin to create bronze - a discovery that fostered economic development and led to the proliferation of trading routes. 

Centuries later, in the 19th Century, the coal-driven Industrial Revolution transformed global economies, leading to rapid urbanization, improved living standards, and exponential economic growth. Fast-forward to the 21st Century - the 'Silicon Age'. The global economy now thrives on technologies fueled by minerals like Lithium for batteries, Rare Earth Elements for electronics, and, indeed, Silicon for computing functions. 

The Significance: The Mineral-Economy Matrix 

Minerals are intertwined with economies at multiple levels. 

1. Job Generation and Industrial Development - Mining and mineral processing industries are significant employment creators. They also spur the growth of ancillary industries, thereby catalyzing broader economic development. The World Economic Forum reports that in many developed nations, every job in the mining industry generates two more in the service sector.

2. Export Earnings - Resource-rich countries earn substantial foreign exchange from mineral exports. Countries like Russia, Australia, and South Africa are prime examples where minerals significantly contribute to GDP.

3. Technological Advancement - Virtually every piece of technology in use today has some mineral element. These elements are crucial in the production processes of computer chips, mobile phones, cars, or satellites.

Instances of Minerals Powering Economies 

Consider a shining example from "down under". Australia's economic steadiness, even during typical global financial crises, is largely attributed to its considerable mineral deposits, which constitute over 70% of its exports. 

Speaking of shining, the Diamond industry of Botswana provides another powerful example. The mineral fuels one-third of its GDP and over 70% of its international earnings.

Expert Take: 

Mining economist, Mark Fellows, once said, "The mineral industry is more than a simple extraction process. It's a multifaceted mechanism driving trade and innovation while supporting sustainable development".

However, the environmental impacts of mining cannot be ignored. Mining significantly contributes to environmental degradation, and there is a pressing need for sustainable mining solutions.

The long-term availability of minerals is another concern. Dr. Jane Goodall encapsulates this worry aptly, stating, "We only have one planet, and we're rapidly depleting the protective resources it offers us. We must tread more lightly on the Earth."

Conclusion:

The impact of minerals on global economies is immense and undeniable. Yet, sustainable and responsible mining remains the need of the hour. As custodians of the planet, we must harness these gifts from below the earth responsibly, ensuring we donâ€™t compromise future generations while meeting our economic aspirations.
